# About Me

I’m a senior Computer Engineering major in the Honors Program at the University of New Hampshire (UNH), maintaining a 3.97 GPA while conducting cutting-edge research in system security at the Resilient Architecture Lab. Over the past two years, I’ve led projects focused on microarchitectural security. This involved designing experiments, analyzing data, and presenting findings at academic conferences.

Beyond research, I love tinkering with hardware: building computers, working with embedded systems, and programming FPGAs. I’m also passionate about machine learning, with coursework in Reinforcement Learning and Natural Language Processing, and hands-on PyTorch experience.

### Description
- **Task:** Create an open-source, automatic tool for discovering vulnerabilities in microarchitecture
- **Action:** Used the Hugging Face API to train a custom Large Language Model, implemented a novel processing algorithm, designed an easy to use front end
- **Results:** Found code snippets that were capable of producing rapid power oscillations, necessary code for a fault injection attack, proving AutoMAD is a promising framework for discovering attacks

## F4kEOUT

This project is still a work in progress, so stay tuned for updated!

- **Focus:** Reverse engineering the address resolution mechanics in the store buffer which causes the 4k aliasing effect on 11th+ generation Intel processors
